These are older versions
Use the new pipeline of Mapqlassify in Perl instead

Contents:
    1. alnxeno - Pipeline 1 (Rossello)
    2. memxeno - Pipeline 2 (Rossello but aln changed to mem)
    3. loxeno - LiftOver pipeline
    4. mapqmem - Mapqlassify pipeline

Usage:
    1. Copy loxeno.config file to run folder
    2. Open loxeno.config, change paths to programs (BWA, samtools, GATK...)
    3. Make sure fastq files have the following format: CASE_NAME-metainfo.fastq.gz or .fastq; CASE_NAME will be used to name output files.
    4. Run pipeline by typing 
          bash script_name.sh <forward_strand_fastq> <reverse_strand_fastq>
    5. A subfolder to run directory will be made, named CASE_NAME
